## Things being done in this version

Hardware:
- [ ] Quieter motors/drivers to eliminate high pitched whine
- [ ] More powerful motors to eliminate the hand spinning setup step
- [ ] Motor controllers that can break to slow disk - for use in disk speed control
- [ ] Change to a larger Nucleo board with Ethernet
- [ ] More disks for a larger range
- [ ] Frame to attach all disks to
- [ ] RGB LED lights!
- [ ] Possibly add resonators
- [ ] Better air blower system that can play multiple notes and hopefully doesn't use a compressor
- [ ] Dedicated power supplies

Software:
- [ ] Send disk speed in rps from max to the nucleo (MIDI pitch bend?)
- [ ] Ethernet communication
